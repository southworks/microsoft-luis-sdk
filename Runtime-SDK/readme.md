This is an unified repo to work on LUIS Client SDKs.

Each folder will be moved to is proper repo:

- data-plane

  https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/current/specification/cognitiveservices/data-plane

- .NET

  https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/psSdkJson6/src/SDKs/CognitiveServices/dataPlane

- JavaScript

  This client SDK is a WIP/Spike and should probably be re-arranged to follow same structure as other NodeJS SDK (e.g.: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-node/tree/master/lib/services/cognitiveServices.Search)
